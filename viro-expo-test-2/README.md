Failed attempst to get ViroReact working withing existing Expo projects.  viro-expo-test-2 was an attempt to integrate it in a brand new expo project. I tried to follow the [explanation](https://viro-community.readme.io/docs/integrating-with-expo) from the ViroReact documentation to add ViroReact to an Expo project and it failed.
