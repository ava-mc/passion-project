## Exploration of image tracking in AR frameworks
For this project, I wanted to explore different web-based and native AR frameworks, specifically for their image tracking functionalities. This means that this github repo is full of demo experiments, both successful and unsuccessful ones. 

To give some clarity, here is a short overview:

- ViroSample

  This is a short image tracking demo starting from the starting kit project ofr ViroReact, an AR framework for React Native. To run it, run 'npm install' and then 'npm run'. In the console you will get an ngrok link. you can use this or your IP address to test out your app via the free Viro Media App.
Note: you will need a device that supports either ARCore or ARKit to be able to run it. (List of devices: [list for ARCore](https://developers.google.com/ar/devices) and [ARKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/arkit/verifying_device_support_and_user_permission).)
