8thwall-code

  I used the 14 day free trial offered by 8th wall, to experiment with the platform. In this trial, you are limited to working on their online Cloud Editor. So, the contents of this folder follow the set-up they use, where I copy pasted the code directly into files with the same name.

 Live demo: https://avamc.8thwall.app/image-tracking-basics
 
 (This demo did not work on my desktop, so you will probably need to test it with your phone. You will also probably land on a project overview page of 8thwall. There should be a button 'launch' that you have to press.)

You can customise the visual AR effects via the query string.
(Options 0, 1, 2 or 3 for model, 0 or 1 for image variable, message variable can be any string).

_Note_: this demo was made with a 14-day free trial, so it could be at the time you are reading this, that the demo is no longer available live.
